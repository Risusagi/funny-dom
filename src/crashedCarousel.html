    <h1>Red pandas</h1>

    <p>Hearing about pandas most of the people think about cute bears with black and white fur. That's why it can be difficult to believe that a small animal that looks like a ginger racoon can be one the subspecies of pandas.</p>
    <p>Red pandas are just a little bit bigger than house cats, but their tail can give them even 50 additional centimeters. A long, bushy tail helps these pandas to balance during their tree walks. They also use it to cover themselves during winters.</p>
    <p>Most of their lives red pandas spend in trees preferring even to sleep aloft. In search of food they usually go down at night or in the gloaming hours of sunset and dawn. As thier bigger brothers these pandas also like bamboo but their diet includes a wider list of foods like fruit, roots or acorns.</p>
